Summary

-------------

In this paper, the researcher tried to investigate the relevance of Moral Foundations Theory(Graham et al. 2007; Haidt 2012) on the party politics of South Korea. The researcher collected thounds of official announcements data of political parties in South Korea, and analyzed their voter mobilization strategy according to the morality frame of MFT. In the analysis procedure, the researcher adopted a word embedding algorithm(Mikolov et al. 2013) to scrutinize and compare the atypical text data of political parties on the form of quantifiable similarity data. The result of analysis suggests that the theory can be applied to explain the moral differences between the conservative and the liberal. Furthermore, the result provides a useful explanation on the voters' strange anti-class voting behavior of the 2012 presidential election. While the egalitarian issues came to the fore at the election, the rhetorical difference between two parties was mainly derived from the morality related to the communitarianism.
